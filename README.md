## Hackathon Info
From [DandyHacks Website](https://dandyhacks.net/): DandyHacks is the University of Rochester’s annual 42-hour long hackathon. This year will be our 10th anniversary, and we’re so excited to hold this amazing milestone in-person! As a fully student-led organization at a tier 1 research university, we embody our school’s values, encouraging participants to question the world and learn more.

## Inspiration
While social media companies such as Facebook or Instagram have become a central way that we connect with other people, they also have dangerous addictive tendencies; causing people to doom-scroll and waste hours of their time achieving nothing.  ClubSpot is designed to break away from these addictive tendencies by focusing on a non-addictive, purposeful platform. Our goal is to create an app where a community can flourish, with clubs able to foster deeper connections with its members without falling into the trap of engagement maximization or superficial competition.

## What it does
Club-Exclusive Posting: Only verified and accepted clubs can post about events.
User Engagement: Users can like and comment on posts, fostering meaningful connections without the competitive and dangerous atmosphere of typical social media platforms.
Simplified Discovery: Users can explore clubs and their activities without being bombarded by unrelated and unproductive content.

## How we built it
**Frontend:** React.js for an intuitive, responsive user interface.
**Backend:** Node.js with Express to handle club registration, post management, and user interactions.
**Database:** MongoDB to manage clubs, users, and posts efficiently.
**Authentication:** MongoDB, jsonwebtokens, bcrypt for pwd hashing to provide secure login and access control for club and user roles.
**Hosting and Deployment:** Hosted on Ubuntu 22.04 with an Nginx Reverse Proxy and Cloudflare acting as another proxy.
